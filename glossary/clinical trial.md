## Phases of clinical trial 

Clinical trials are usually divided into different phases. The early ones look at whether a drug is safe or the side effects it causes. While later phase trials aim to compare new treatment to existing ones.

There are three main phases of clinical trials. However some trials are conducted before phase I -- called phase 0, and some, called phase IV trials, are done after a drug has been licensed.

| Phase | Size   | Objectives                        | Randomised |
| ----- | ------ | --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| I     | small  | Toxicity/Side effects             | No         |
| II    | medium | Efficacy                          | Sometimes  |
| III   | large  | Compare new treatment to standard | Usually           |
